### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

maxinunezz is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because it's my first time doing this!!! I recently finished the SoyHenry Bootcamp, and I'm very excited to start this new part of my life.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ... a personal project to continue learning about IT. I would love to become a Backend Developer.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... about TypeScript, Nest.js, and deepening my knowledge of Node.js and Express.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate with ... a good company to level up my abilities and provide me with the confidence to keep learning.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ... Anything! I'm an open book. Just remember to be respectful :)
